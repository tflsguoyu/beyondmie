## [Testing]

### Added
- H field calculation
- Poynting vector plotting
- benchmark simulation script and data for MSTM
- dedicated `initialField.type` for plane waves (previously a Gaussian beam with infinite waist)

### Changed
- naming of output methods are now specific for E and H fields
- the `focalPoint` parameter of `initialField` renamed to `referencePoint`


## [Unreleased]


## [2.2] - 2021-04-13
### Changed
- subclass celes classes from `matlab.System`
- implement `setProperties` methods for name-value style initialization
- implement `validatePropertiesImpl` methods for validation
- limit use of `Dependent` properties to avoid redundant calculations
- implement `setupImpl` where appropriate for one-time calculations to improve performance
- compute and set maximal particle distance inside particles class
- prefer implicit expansion over `bsxfun` (requires MATLAB >= R2016b)
- fancier, faster plotting functions
- use convex hull in compute_maximal_particle_distance
- provide robust, fallback method for compute_maximal_particle_distance
- avoid recompiling .mex files if already available

### Fixed
- don't try to compute initial power for plane waves
- fix bug in scattered field plots

## [2.1] - 2017-10-25
### Changed
- define only trigonometric versions of legendre and spherical functions
- precalculate coefficients in spherical functions @tkfryett
- case-insensitive flags and types

### Removed
- `disperse` flag (radii must be specified)

### Fixed
- performance issue with polydisperse samples @fragkrag

## [2.0] - 2017-09-22
### Added
- support for polydisperse sphere size and refractive index @fragkrag

### Changed
- patch MATLAB's built-in GMRES to monitor progress
- unified log messages from iterative solvers
- gather arrays from GPU to save memory when using GMRES
- precalculate maximal particle distance

### Removed
- monitor flag for iterative solvers

### Fixed
- fix wrong sign for downward propagation of PWP Gaussian beam
